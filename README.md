# Locations App
The purpose of the LocationsApp is to allow urban-travellers to mark points of interest on a map. We envision this app being useful for a traveller who wants to avoid the typical tourist sites and want to experience a city's "hidden gems".

# Under the Hood
- This application uses the Google Maps Javascipt API, Geolocation Services and Reverse Geo-Coding.
- This application utilizes a Firebase realtime database to store user pinned locations
- The front end of the application uses Bootstrap along with the animate.js library for simple animations
